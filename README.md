# vbs-xml-parser
A personal XML parser made using only my logical capabilities. Took me 3 whole days to get this to work

I have no idea about the difference of "reading" or "parsing" so you might see some terminologies in variable names being interpretted incorrectly

Btw this was made with the mindset of "if it somehow got the expected result, then it's probably done", so there might be lots of bugs and errors that I've yet to encounter and fix
